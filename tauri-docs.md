Configuration
The Tauri configuration object. It is read from a file where you can define your frontend assets, configure the bundler and define a tray icon.

The configuration file is generated by the tauri init command that lives in your Tauri application source directory (src-tauri).

Once generated, you may modify it at will to customize your Tauri application.

File Formats
By default, the configuration is defined as a JSON file named tauri.conf.json.

Tauri also supports JSON5 and TOML files via the config-json5 and config-toml Cargo features, respectively. The JSON5 file name must be either tauri.conf.json or tauri.conf.json5. The TOML file name is Tauri.toml.

Platform-Specific Configuration
In addition to the default configuration file, Tauri can read a platform-specific configuration from tauri.linux.conf.json, tauri.windows.conf.json, tauri.macos.conf.json, tauri.android.conf.json and tauri.ios.conf.json (or Tauri.linux.toml, Tauri.windows.toml, Tauri.macos.toml, Tauri.android.toml and Tauri.ios.toml if the Tauri.toml format is used), which gets merged with the main configuration object.

Configuration Structure
The configuration is composed of the following objects:

app: The Tauri configuration
build: The build configuration
bundle: The bundle configurations
plugins: The plugins configuration
Example tauri.config.json file:

identifier
string

The application identifier in reverse domain name notation (e.g. com.tauri.example). This string must be unique across applications since it is used in system configurations like the bundle ID and path to the webview data directory. This string must contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, and 0-9), hyphens (-), and periods (.).

mainBinaryName
string | null

Overrides app’s main binary filename.

By default, Tauri uses the output binary from cargo, by setting this, we will rename that binary in tauri-cli’s tauri build command, and target tauri bundle to it

If possible, change the package name or set the name field instead, and if that’s not enough and you’re using nightly, consider using the different-binary-name feature instead

Note: this config should not include the binary extension (e.g. .exe), we’ll add that for you

plugins
PluginConfig

The plugins config.

Default: {}

productName
string | null pattern of ^[^/\:*?"<>|]+$

App name.

version
string | null

App version. It is a semver version number or a path to a package.json file containing the version field.

If removed the version number from Cargo.toml is used. It’s recommended to manage the app versioning in the Tauri config.

Platform-specific
macOS: Translates to the bundle’s CFBundleShortVersionString property and is used as the default CFBundleVersion. You can set an specific bundle version using bundle &gt; macOS &gt; bundleVersion.
iOS: Translates to the bundle’s CFBundleShortVersionString property and is used as the default CFBundleVersion. You can set an specific bundle version using bundle &gt; iOS &gt; bundleVersion. The tauri ios build CLI command has a --build-number &lt;number&gt; option that lets you append a build number to the app version.
Android: By default version 1.0 is used. You can set a version code using bundle &gt; android &gt; versionCode.
By default version 1.0 is used on Android.

Definitions
AndroidConfig
General configuration for the Android target.

Object Properties:

autoIncrementVersionCode
minSdkVersion
versionCode
autoIncrementVersionCode
boolean

Whether to automatically increment the versionCode on each build.

If true, the generator will try to read the last versionCode from tauri.properties and increment it by 1 for every build.
If false or not set, it falls back to version_code or semver-derived logic.
Note that to use this feature, you should remove /tauri.properties from src-tauri/gen/android/app/.gitignore so the current versionCode is committed to the repository.

minSdkVersion
integer formatted as uint32

The minimum API level required for the application to run. The Android system will prevent the user from installing the application if the system’s API level is lower than the value specified.

Default: 24

versionCode
integer | null maximum of 2100000000, minimum of 1, formatted as uint32

The version code of the application. It is limited to 2,100,000,000 as per Google Play Store requirements.

By default we use your configured version and perform the following math: versionCode = version.major * 1000000 + version.minor * 1000 + version.patch

AppConfig
The App configuration object.

See more: <https://v2.tauri.app/reference/config/#appconfig>

Object Properties:

enableGTKAppId
boolean

If set to true “identifier” will be set as GTK app ID (on systems that use GTK).

macOSPrivateApi
boolean

MacOS private API configuration. Enables the transparent background API and sets the fullScreenEnabled preference to true.

security
SecurityConfig

Security configuration.

Default
{
  "assetProtocol": {
    "enable": false,
    "scope": []
  },
  "capabilities": [],
  "dangerousDisableAssetCspModification": false,
  "freezePrototype": false,
  "pattern": {
    "use": "brownfield"
  }
}

trayIcon
TrayIconConfig | null

Configuration for app tray icon.

windows
WindowConfig[]

The app windows configuration.

Example:
To create a window at app startup

{
  "app": {
    "windows": [
      { "width": 800, "height": 600 }
    ]
  }
}

If not specified, the window’s label (its identifier) defaults to “main”, you can use this label to get the window through app.get_webview_window in Rust or WebviewWindow.getByLabel in JavaScript

When working with multiple windows, each window will need an unique label

{
  "app": {
    "windows": [
      { "label": "main", "width": 800, "height": 600 },
      { "label": "secondary", "width": 800, "height": 600 }
    ]
  }
}

You can also set create to false and use this config through the Rust APIs

{
  "app": {
    "windows": [
      { "create": false, "width": 800, "height": 600 }
    ]
  }
}

and use it like this

tauri::Builder::default()
  .setup(|app| {
    tauri::WebviewWindowBuilder::from_config(app.handle(), app.config().app.windows[0])?.build()?;
    Ok(())
  });

Default: []

Background throttling policy.

BeforeDevCommand
Any of the following:

string Run the given script with the default options.

BuildConfig
The Build configuration object.

See more: <https://v2.tauri.app/reference/config/#buildconfig>

Object Properties:

additionalWatchFolders
beforeBuildCommand
beforeBundleCommand
beforeDevCommand
devUrl
features
frontendDist
removeUnusedCommands
runner
additionalWatchFolders
string[]

Additional paths to watch for changes when running tauri dev.

Default: []

beforeBuildCommand
HookCommand | null

A shell command to run before tauri build kicks in.

The TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM, TAURI_ENV_ARCH, TAURI_ENV_FAMILY, TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM_VERSION, TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM_TYPE and TAURI_ENV_DEBUG environment variables are set if you perform conditional compilation.

beforeBundleCommand
HookCommand | null

A shell command to run before the bundling phase in tauri build kicks in.

The TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM, TAURI_ENV_ARCH, TAURI_ENV_FAMILY, TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM_VERSION, TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM_TYPE and TAURI_ENV_DEBUG environment variables are set if you perform conditional compilation.

beforeDevCommand
BeforeDevCommand | null

A shell command to run before tauri dev kicks in.

The TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM, TAURI_ENV_ARCH, TAURI_ENV_FAMILY, TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM_VERSION, TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM_TYPE and TAURI_ENV_DEBUG environment variables are set if you perform conditional compilation.

devUrl
string | null formatted as uri

The URL to load in development.

This is usually an URL to a dev server, which serves your application assets with hot-reload and HMR. Most modern JavaScript bundlers like Vite provides a way to start a dev server by default.

If you don’t have a dev server or don’t want to use one, ignore this option and use frontendDist and point to a web assets directory, and Tauri CLI will run its built-in dev server and provide a simple hot-reload experience.

features
string[] | null

Features passed to cargo commands.

frontendDist
FrontendDist | null

The path to the application assets (usually the dist folder of your javascript bundler) or a URL that could be either a custom protocol registered in the tauri app (for example: myprotocol://) or a remote URL (for example: https://site.com/app).

When a path relative to the configuration file is provided, it is read recursively and all files are embedded in the application binary. Tauri then looks for an index.html and serves it as the default entry point for your application.

You can also provide a list of paths to be embedded, which allows granular control over what files are added to the binary. In this case, all files are added to the root and you must reference it that way in your HTML files.

When a URL is provided, the application won’t have bundled assets and the application will load that URL by default.

removeUnusedCommands
boolean

Try to remove unused commands registered from plugins base on the ACL list during tauri build, the way it works is that tauri-cli will read this and set the environment variables for the build script and macros, and they’ll try to get all the allowed commands and remove the rest

Note:

This won’t be accounting for dynamically added ACLs when you use features from the dynamic-acl (currently enabled by default) feature flag, so make sure to check it when using this
This feature requires tauri-plugin 2.1 and tauri 2.4
runner
RunnerConfig | null

The binary used to build and run the application.

externalBin
string[] | null

A list of—either absolute or relative—paths to binaries to embed with your application.

Note that Tauri will look for system-specific binaries following the pattern “binary-name{-target-triple}{.system-extension}”.

E.g. for the external binary “my-binary”, Tauri looks for:

“my-binary-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe” for Windows
“my-binary-x86_64-apple-darwin” for macOS
“my-binary-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu” for Linux
so don’t forget to provide binaries for all targeted platforms.

    }
  },
  "files": {},

Currently maps to the Manufacturer property of the Windows Installer and the Maintainer field of debian packages if the Cargo.toml does not have the authors field.

resources
BundleResources | null

App resources to bundle. Each resource is a path to a file or directory. Glob patterns are supported.

Examples
To include a list of files:

{
  "bundle": {
    "resources": [
      "./path/to/some-file.txt",
      "/absolute/path/to/textfile.txt",
      "../relative/path/to/jsonfile.json",
      "some-folder/",
      "resources/**/*.md"
    ]
  }
}

The bundled files will be in $RESOURCES/ with the original directory structure preserved, for example: ./path/to/some-file.txt -> $RESOURCE/path/to/some-file.txt

To fine control where the files will get copied to, use a map instead

{
  "bundle": {
    "resources": {
      "/absolute/path/to/textfile.txt": "resources/textfile.txt",
      "relative/path/to/jsonfile.json": "resources/jsonfile.json",
      "resources/": "",
      "docs/**/*md": "website-docs/"
    }
  }
}

Note that when using glob pattern in this case, the original directory structure is not preserved, everything gets copied to the target directory directly

See more: <https://v2.tauri.app/develop/resources/>

shortDescription

A short description of your application.

targets
BundleTarget

The bundle targets, currently supports [“deb”, “rpm”, “appimage”, “nsis”, “msi”, “app”, “dmg”] or “all”.

Default: "all"

useLocalToolsDir
boolean

Whether to use the project’s target directory, for caching build tools (e.g., Wix and NSIS) when building this application. Defaults to false.

If true, tools will be cached in target/.tauri/. If false, tools will be cached in the current user’s platform-specific cache directory.

An example where it can be appropriate to set this to true is when building this application as a Windows System user (e.g., AWS EC2 workloads), because the Window system’s app data directory is restricted.

windows
WindowsConfig

Configuration for the Windows bundles.

Default
{
  "allowDowngrades": true,
  "certificateThumbprint": null,
  "digestAlgorithm": null,
  "nsis": null,
  "signCommand": null,
  "timestampUrl": null,
  "tsp": false,
  "webviewInstallMode": {
    "silent": true,
    "type": "downloadBootstrapper"
  },
  "wix": null
}

"QLGenerator" CFBundleTypeRole.QLGenerator
"None" CFBundleTypeRole.None
macOS-only. Corresponds to CFBundleTypeRole

Capability
A grouping and boundary mechanism developers can use to isolate access to the IPC layer.

It controls application windows’ and webviews’ fine grained access to the Tauri core, application, or plugin commands. If a webview or its window is not matching any capability then it has no access to the IPC layer at all.

This can be done to create groups of windows, based on their required system access, which can reduce impact of frontend vulnerabilities in less privileged windows. Windows can be added to a capability by exact name (e.g. main-window) or glob patterns like * or admin-*. A Window can have none, one, or multiple associated capabilities.

Example
{
  "identifier": "main-user-files-write",
  "description": "This capability allows the `main` window on macOS and Windows access to `filesystem` write related commands and `dialog` commands to enable programmatic access to files selected by the user.",
  "windows": [
    "main"
  ],
  "permissions": [
    "core:default",
    "dialog:open",
    {
      "identifier": "fs:allow-write-text-file",
      "allow": [{ "path": "$HOME/test.txt" }]
    },
  ],
  "platforms": ["macOS","windows"]
}

Object Properties:

description
identifier (required)
local
permissions (required)
platforms
remote
webviews
windows
description
string

Description of what the capability is intended to allow on associated windows.

It should contain a description of what the grouped permissions should allow.

Example
This capability allows the main window access to filesystem write related commands and dialog commands to enable programmatic access to files selected by the user.

identifier
string

Identifier of the capability.

Example
main-user-files-write

local
boolean

Whether this capability is enabled for local app URLs or not. Defaults to true.

Default: true

permissions
PermissionEntry[] each item must be unique

List of permissions attached to this capability.

Must include the plugin name as prefix in the form of ${plugin-name}:${permission-name}. For commands directly implemented in the application itself only ${permission-name} is required.

Example
[
  "core:default",
  "shell:allow-open",
  "dialog:open",
  {
    "identifier": "fs:allow-write-text-file",
    "allow": [{ "path": "$HOME/test.txt" }]
  }
]

{
  "urls": ["https://*.mydomain.dev"]
}

webviews
string[]

List of webviews that are affected by this capability. Can be a glob pattern.

The capability will be enabled on all the webviews whose label matches any of the patterns in this list, regardless of whether the webview’s window label matches a pattern in [Self::windows].

Example
["sub-webview-one", "sub-webview-two"]

windows
string[]

List of windows that are affected by this capability. Can be a glob pattern.

If a window label matches any of the patterns in this list, the capability will be enabled on all the webviews of that window, regardless of the value of [Self::webviews].

On multiwebview windows, prefer specifying [Self::webviews] and omitting [Self::windows] for a fine grained access control.

Example
["main"]

CapabilityEntry
Any of the following:

Capability An inlined capability.
string Reference to a capability identifier.
A capability entry which can be either an inlined capability or a reference to a capability defined on its own file.

CustomSignCommandConfig
Any of the following:

string A string notation of the script to execute. “%1” will be replaced with the path to the binary to be signed. This is a simpler notation for the command. Tauri will split the string with ' ' and use the first element as the command name and the rest as arguments. If you need to use whitespace in the command or arguments, use the object notation [Self::ScriptWithOptions].
An object notation of the command. This is more complex notation for the command but this allows you to use whitespace in the command and arguments. Object Properties: - args (required) - cmd (required) ##### args string[] The arguments to pass to the command. “%1” will be replaced with the path to the binary to be signed. ##### cmd string The command to run to sign the binary.

HeaderConfig
A struct, where the keys are some specific http header names.

If the values to those keys are defined, then they will be send as part of a response message. This does not include error messages and ipc messages

Example configuration
{
 //..
  app:{
    //..
    security: {
      headers: {
        "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": "same-origin",
        "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": "require-corp",
        "Timing-Allow-Origin": [
          "https://developer.mozilla.org",
          "https://example.com",
        ],
        "Access-Control-Expose-Headers": "Tauri-Custom-Header",
        "Tauri-Custom-Header": {
          "key1": "'value1' 'value2'",
          "key2": "'value3'"
        }
      },
      csp: "default-src 'self'; connect-src ipc: http://ipc.localhost",
    }
    //..
  }
 //..
}

In this example Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy and Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy are set to allow for the use of SharedArrayBuffer. The result is, that those headers are then set on every response sent via the get_response function in crates/tauri/src/protocol/tauri.rs. The Content-Security-Policy header is defined separately, because it is also handled separately.

For the helloworld example, this config translates into those response headers:

access-control-allow-origin:  http://tauri.localhost
access-control-expose-headers: Tauri-Custom-Header
content-security-policy: default-src 'self'; connect-src ipc: http://ipc.localhost; script-src 'self' 'sha256-Wjjrs6qinmnr+tOry8x8PPwI77eGpUFR3EEGZktjJNs='
content-type: text/html
cross-origin-embedder-policy: require-corp
cross-origin-opener-policy: same-origin
tauri-custom-header: key1 'value1' 'value2'; key2 'value3'
timing-allow-origin: https://developer.mozilla.org, https://example.com

Since the resulting header values are always ‘string-like’. So depending on the what data type the HeaderSource is, they need to be converted.

String(JS/Rust): stay the same for the resulting header value
Array(JS)/Vec\&lt;String\&gt;(Rust): Item are joined by ”, ” for the resulting header value
Object(JS)/ Hashmap\&lt;String,String\&gt;(Rust): Items are composed from: key + space + value. Item are then joined by ”; ” for the resulting header value

The Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header is used in response to a preflight request which includes the Access-Control-Request-Headers to indicate which HTTP headers can be used during the actual request.

This header is required if the request has an Access-Control-Request-Headers header.

See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers>

Access-Control-Allow-Methods
HeaderSource | null

The Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header specifies one or more methods allowed when accessing a resource in response to a preflight request.

Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy
HeaderSource | null

The HTTP Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy (COEP) response header configures embedding cross-origin resources into the document.

See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy>

Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy
HeaderSource | null

The HTTP Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) response header allows you to ensure a top-level document does not share a browsing context group with cross-origin documents. COOP will process-isolate your document and potential attackers can’t access your global object if they were to open it in a popup, preventing a set of cross-origin attacks dubbed XS-Leaks.

See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy>

Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy
HeaderSource | null

The HTTP Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy response header conveys a desire that the browser blocks no-cors cross-origin/cross-site requests to the given resource.

See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy>

Permissions-Policy
HeaderSource | null

The HTTP Permissions-Policy header provides a mechanism to allow and deny the use of browser features in a document or within any &lt;iframe&gt; elements in the document.

See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy>

Service-Worker-Allowed
HeaderSource | null

The HTTP Service-Worker-Allowed response header is used to broaden the path restriction for a service worker’s default scope.

By default, the scope for a service worker registration is the directory where the service worker script is located. For example, if the script sw.js is located in /js/sw.js, it can only control URLs under /js/ by default. Servers can use the Service-Worker-Allowed header to allow a service worker to control URLs outside of its own directory.

See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Service-Worker-Allowed>

Tauri-Custom-Header
HeaderSource | null

See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Timing-Allow-Origin>

X-Content-Type-Options
HeaderSource | null

The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should be followed and not be changed. The header allows you to avoid MIME type sniffing by saying that the MIME types are deliberately configured.

See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options>

AssetProtocolConfig

Custom protocol config.

Default
{
  "enable": false,
  "scope": []
}

capabilities
CapabilityEntry[]

List of capabilities that are enabled on the application.

By default (not set or empty list), all capability files from ./capabilities/ are included, by setting values in this entry, you have fine grained control over which capabilities are included

You can either reference a capability file defined in ./capabilities/ with its identifier or inline a [Capability]

Example
{
  "app": {
    "capabilities": [
      "main-window",
      {
        "identifier": "drag-window",
        "permissions": ["core:window:allow-start-dragging"]
      }
    ]
  }
}

Default: []

csp
Csp | null

The Content Security Policy that will be injected on all HTML files on the built application. If dev_csp is not specified, this value is also injected on dev.

This is a really important part of the configuration since it helps you ensure your WebView is secured. See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP>.

dangerousDisableAssetCspModification
DisabledCspModificationKind

Disables the Tauri-injected CSP sources.

At compile time, Tauri parses all the frontend assets and changes the Content-Security-Policy to only allow loading of your own scripts and styles by injecting nonce and hash sources. This stricts your CSP, which may introduce issues when using along with other flexing sources.

This configuration option allows both a boolean and a list of strings as value. A boolean instructs Tauri to disable the injection for all CSP injections, and a list of strings indicates the CSP directives that Tauri cannot inject.

WARNING: Only disable this if you know what you are doing and have properly configured the CSP. Your application might be vulnerable to XSS attacks without this Tauri protection.

devCsp
Csp | null

The Content Security Policy that will be injected on all HTML files on development.

This is a really important part of the configuration since it helps you ensure your WebView is secured. See <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP>.

freezePrototype

Theme
One of the following:

"Light" Light theme.
"Dark" Dark theme.
System theme.

TitleBarStyle
One of the following:

"Visible" A normal title bar.
"Transparent" Makes the title bar transparent, so the window background color is shown instead. Useful if you don’t need to have actual HTML under the title bar. This lets you avoid the caveats of using TitleBarStyle::Overlay. Will be more useful when Tauri lets you set a custom window background color.
"Overlay" Shows the title bar as a transparent overlay over the window’s content. Keep in mind: - The height of the title bar is different on different OS versions, which can lead to window the controls and title not being where you don’t expect. - You need to define a custom drag region to make your window draggable, however due to a limitation you can’t drag the window when it’s not in focus <https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/4316>. - The color of the window title depends on the system theme.
How the window title bar should be displayed on macOS.

TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY — Private key used to sign your app bundles, can be either a string or a path to the file.
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD — The signing private key password, see TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY.
TAURI_SIGNING_RPM_KEY — The private GPG key used to sign the RPM bundle, exported to its ASCII-armored format.
TAURI_SIGNING_RPM_KEY_PASSPHRASE — The GPG key passphrase for TAURI_SIGNING_RPM_KEY, if needed.
TAURI_WINDOWS_SIGNTOOL_PATH — Specify a path to signtool.exe used for code signing the application on Windows.
APPLE_CERTIFICATE — Base64 encoded of the .p12 certificate for code signing. To get this value, run openssl base64 -in MyCertificate.p12 -out MyCertificate-base64.txt.
APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD — The password you used to export the certificate.
APPLE_ID — The Apple ID used to notarize the application. If this environment variable is provided, APPLE_PASSWORD and APPLE_TEAM_ID must also be set. Alternatively, APPLE_API_KEY and APPLE_API_ISSUER can be used to authenticate.
APPLE_PASSWORD — The Apple password used to authenticate for application notarization. Required if APPLE_ID is specified. An app-specific password can be used. Alternatively to entering the password in plaintext, it may also be specified using a ‘@keychain:’ or ‘@env:’ prefix followed by a keychain password item name or environment variable name.
APPLE_TEAM_ID: Developer team ID. To find your Team ID, go to the Account page on the Apple Developer website, and check your membership details.
APPLE_API_KEY — Alternative to APPLE_ID and APPLE_PASSWORD for notarization authentication using JWT. Also an option to allow automated iOS certificate and provisioning profile management.
See creating API keys for more information.
API_PRIVATE_KEYS_DIR — Specify the directory where your AuthKey file is located. See APPLE_API_KEY.
APPLE_API_ISSUER — Issuer ID. Required if APPLE_API_KEY is specified.
APPLE_API_KEY_PATH - path to the API key .p8 file. If not specified, for macOS apps the bundler searches the following directories in sequence for a private key file with the name of ‘AuthKey_<api_key>.p8’: ’./private_keys’, ‘/private_keys’, ‘/.private_keys’, and ’~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys’. For iOS this variable is required.
APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY — The identity used to code sign. Overwrites tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > signingIdentity. If neither are set, it is inferred from APPLE_CERTIFICATE when provided.
APPLE_PROVIDER_SHORT_NAME — If your Apple ID is connected to multiple teams, you have to specify the provider short name of the team you want to use to notarize your app. Overwrites tauri.conf.json > bundle > macOS > providerShortName.
APPLE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM — The team ID used to code sign on iOS. Overwrites tauri.conf.json > bundle > iOS > developmentTeam. Can be found in https://developer.apple.com/account#MembershipDetailsCard.
TAURI_WEBVIEW_AUTOMATION — Enables webview automation (Linux Only).
TAURI_ANDROID_PROJECT_PATH — Path of the tauri android project, usually will be <project>/src-tauri/gen/android.
TAURI_IOS_PROJECT_PATH — Path of the tauri iOS project, usually will be <project>/src-tauri/gen/ios.
Tauri CLI Hook Commands
These environment variables are set for each hook command (beforeDevCommand, beforeBuildCommand, …etc) which could be useful to conditionally build your frontend or execute a specific action.

TAURI_ENV_DEBUG — true for dev command or build --debug, false otherwise.
TAURI_ENV_TARGET_TRIPLE — Target triple the CLI is building.
TAURI_ENV_ARCH — Target arch, x86_64, aarch64…etc.
TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM — Target platform, windows, darwin, linux…etc.
TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM_VERSION — Build platform version
TAURI_ENV_FAMILY — Target platform family unix or windows.

Webview Versions
WebView2 (Windows)
Tauri uses WebView2 which is based on Microsoft Edge and therefore Chromium. WebView2 can update itself, you are guaranteed a relatively recent chromium build on all Windows targets.

WebView2 is supported on Windows 7 and newer and comes preinstalled on Windows 11. On versions older than Windows 11 the installer generated by Tauri takes care of ensuring WebView2 is installed on the system.

WebKit (macOS, iOS, & Linux)
Tauri uses WebKit on macOS (through WKWebView) and Linux (through webkit2gtk).

Interpreting WebKit Version Numbers
Webkit version numbers are quite complicated, so below is some helpful information to understand them.

WebKit version numbers are made up of 5 segments and a numeric prefix indicating which OS WebKit is built for:

$(SYSTEM_VERSION_PREFIX)$(MAJOR_VERSION).$(MINOR_VERSION).$(TINY_VERSION).$(MICRO_VERSION).$(NANO_VERSION)

The numeric prefix is called the SYSTEM_VERSION_PREFIX and seems to be only present for macOS and iOS builds (not for Linux). Furthermore, if the last two segments are both 0 they can be omitted (so a version like 613.2.7.0.0 would be referred to as 613.2.7).

As an example, the WebKit version shipped with Safari 15.5 on macOS Monterey (12.x) has the version number 17613.2.7.1.8. You can interpret it like this:

SYSTEM_VERSION_PREFIX: 17
MAJOR_VERSION: 613
MINOR_VERSION: 2
TINY_VERSION: 7
MICRO_VERSION: 1
NANO_VERSION: 8
Here is what the SYSTEM_VERSION_PREFIX values map to:

macOS version	SYSTEM_VERSION_PREFIX
sdk=iphone*	8
14.0	19
13.0	18
12.0	17
11.0	16
10.15	15
10.14	14
10.13	13
10.12	12
10.11	11
macOS & iOS
On macOS, Tauri uses the webview that comes preinstalled with macOS since version 10.10 (Yosemite). It is considered a core component and is therefore updated with the regular OS updates. This means unsupported macOS versions do not receive WebKit updates.

To find the WebKit version used by WKWebView on your version of macOS you can use this command in the terminal:

Terminal window
awk '/CFBundleVersion/{getline;gsub(/<[^>]*>/,"");print}' /System/Library/Frameworks/WebKit.framework/Resources/Info.plist

WebKit Versions in Safari
The table below maps an OS version to the corresponding WebKit Safari versions so that you can use sites like caniuse to figure out if a specific web platform feature is supported.

Linux
The diverse nature of the Linux ecosystem means it is very hard to compile accurate information about WebKitGTK on the various distros. The table below is a very incomplete list of the most commonly used distributions and their WebKit versions. You should always check your distro’s repositories for up-to-date information.
